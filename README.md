# magicavoxel-mesh-exporter
MagicaVoxel exporter that names exported meshes using MagicaVoxel layer and node names.  This repository contains a reproducible scaffold for parsing MagicaVoxel .vox files, extracting per-part voxels and human-readable names (from layers and node attributes), exporting each part to an OBJ file, and reporting empty layers.
